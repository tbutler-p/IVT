Pygments
~~~~~~~~

Pygments is a syntax highlighting package written in Python.

It is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software
such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to prettify
source code. Highlights are:

* a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
* special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
* support for new languages and formats are added easily
* a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX, RTF, SVG, all image
  formats that PIL supports, and ANSI sequences
* it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
* ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!

The `Pygments master branch`_ is installable with ``easy_install Pygments==dev``.

.. _Pygments master branch:

#### lex

```python
def lex(code, lexer)
```

Lex `code` with the `lexer` (must be a `Lexer` instance)
and return an iterable of tokens. Currently, this only calls
`lexer.get_tokens()`.

<a id="pygments.format"></a>

#### format

```python
def format(tokens, formatter, outfile=None)
```

Format ``tokens`` (an iterable of tokens) with the formatter ``formatter``
(a `Formatter` instance).

If ``outfile`` is given and a valid file object (an object with a
``write`` method), the result will be written to it, otherwise it
is returned as a string.

<a id="pygments.highlight"></a>

#### highlight

```python
def highlight(code, lexer, formatter, outfile=None)
```

This is the most high-level highlighting function. It combines `lex` and
`format` in one function.
