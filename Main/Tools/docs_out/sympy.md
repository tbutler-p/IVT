# sympy

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a
full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple
as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.  SymPy is
written entirely in Python. It depends on mpmath, and other external libraries
may be optionally for things like plotting support.
