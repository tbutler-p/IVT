        The comment is added to the end of the comments collection and is assigned a unique
        comment-id.

        If `text` is provided, it is added to the comment. This option provides for the common
        case where a comment contains a modest passage of plain text. Multiple paragraphs can be
        added using the `text` argument by separating their text with newlines (`"\\\\n"`).
        Between newlines, text is interpreted as it is in `Document.add_paragraph(text=...)`.

        The default is to place a single empty paragraph in the comment, which is the same
        behavior as the Word UI when you add a comment. New runs can be added to the first
        paragraph in the empty comment with `comments.paragraphs[0].add_run()` to adding more
        complex text with emphasis or images. Additional paragraphs can be added using
        `.add_paragraph()`.

        `author` is a required attribute, set to the empty string by default.

        `initials` is an optional attribute, set to the empty string by default. Passing |None|
        for the `initials` parameter causes that attribute to be omitted from the XML.

    sentence or phrase.
