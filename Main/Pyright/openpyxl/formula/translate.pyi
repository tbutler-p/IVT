"""
This module contains code to translate formulae across cells in a worksheet.

The idea is that if A1 has formula "=B1+C1", then translating it to cell A2
results in formula "=B2+C2". The algorithm relies on the formula tokenizer
to identify the parts of the formula that need to change.

"""
class TranslatorError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when a formula can't be translated across cells.

    This error arises when a formula's references would be translated outside
    the worksheet's bounds on the top or left. Excel represents these
    situations with a #REF! literal error. E.g., if the formula at B2 is
    '=A1', attempting to translate the formula to B1 raises TranslatorError,
    since there's no cell above A1. Similarly, translating the same formula
    from B2 to A2 raises TranslatorError, since there's no cell to the left of
    A1.
