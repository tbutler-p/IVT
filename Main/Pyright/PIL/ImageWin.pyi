    A Windows bitmap with the given mode and size.  The mode can be one of "1",

    If the display requires a palette, this constructor creates a suitable
    palette and associates it with the image. For an "L" image, 128 graylevels
    are allocated. For an "RGB" image, a 6x6x6 colour cube is used, together
    with 20 graylevels.

    ``palette`` method upon certain events from Windows.
