        Calculate statistics for the given image. If a mask is included,
        only the regions covered by that mask are included in the

        :param image: A PIL image, or a precalculated histogram.

            .. note::

                For a PIL image, calculations rely on the
                :py:meth:`~PIL.Image.Image.histogram` method. The pixel counts are
                grouped into 256 bins, even if the image has more than 8 bits per
                channel. So ``I`` and ``F`` mode images have a maximum ``mean``,
                ``median`` and ``rms`` of 255, and cannot have an ``extrema`` maximum
                of more than 255.

        :param mask: An optional mask.

        .. note::
            This relies on the :py:meth:`~PIL.Image.Image.histogram` method, and
            simply returns the low and high bins used. This is correct for
            images with 8 bits per channel, but fails for other modes such as
            ``I`` or ``F``. Instead, use :py:meth:`~PIL.Image.Image.getextrema` to
            return per-band extrema for the image. This is more correct and
            efficient because, for non-8-bit modes, the histogram method uses
            :py:meth:`~PIL.Image.Image.getextrema` to determine the bins used.
