            Defaults to None, which means [`dispatch_model`] will not be called.
        max_memory (`Dict`, *optional*):
            A dictionary device identifier to maximum memory. Will default to the maximum memory available for each GPU

        offload_buffers (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            In the layers that are offloaded on the CPU or the hard drive, whether or not to offload the buffers as
            well as the parameters.
        dtype (`str` or `torch.dtype`, *optional*):
            If provided, the weights will be converted to that type when loaded.
        offload_state_dict (`bool`, *optional*):

            the weight of the CPU state dict + the biggest shard does not fit. Will default to `True` if the device map

            single device.
        strict (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to strictly enforce that the keys in the checkpoint state_dict match the keys of the model's
            state_dict.
        full_state_dict (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`): if this is set to `True`, all the tensors in the
            loaded state_dict will be gathered. No ShardedTensor and DTensor will be in the loaded state_dict.
        broadcast_from_rank0 (`False`, *optional*, defaults to `False`): when the option is `True`, a distributed
            `ProcessGroup` must be initialized. rank0 should receive a full state_dict and will broadcast the tensors
            in the state_dict one by one to other ranks. Other ranks will receive the tensors and shard (if applicable)
            according to the local shards in the model.

    Applies layerwise casting to a given module. The module expected here is a PyTorch `nn.Module`. This is helpful for

    `torch.float8_e4m3fn` and upcasted to a higher precision like `torch.bfloat16` during forward pass and downcasted
    back to `torch.float8_e4m3fn` to realize memory savings.

            A list of patterns to match the names of the modules to skip during the layerwise casting process. If set

            If `True`, the weight casting operations are non-blocking.

    >>> import torch

    >>> # Model
