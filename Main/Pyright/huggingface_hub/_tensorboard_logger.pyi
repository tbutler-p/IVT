class HFSummaryWriter(_RuntimeSummaryWriter):
    """
    Wrapper around the tensorboard's `SummaryWriter` to push training logs to the Hub.

    Data is logged locally and then pushed to the Hub asynchronously. Pushing data to the Hub is done in a separate
    thread to avoid blocking the training script. In particular, if the upload fails for any reason (e.g. a connection
    issue), the main script will not be interrupted. Data is automatically pushed to the Hub every `commit_every`
    minutes (default to every 5 minutes).

    > [!WARNING]
    > `HFSummaryWriter` is experimental. Its API is subject to change in the future without prior notice.

    Args:
        repo_id (`str`):
            The id of the repo to which the logs will be pushed.
        logdir (`str`, *optional*):
            The directory where the logs will be written. If not specified, a local directory will be created by the
            underlying `SummaryWriter` object.
        commit_every (`int` or `float`, *optional*):
            The frequency (in minutes) at which the logs will be pushed to the Hub. Defaults to 5 minutes.
        squash_history (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to squash the history of the repo after each commit. Defaults to `False`. Squashing commits is
            useful to avoid degraded performances on the repo when it grows too large.
        repo_type (`str`, *optional*):
            The type of the repo to which the logs will be pushed. Defaults to "model".
        repo_revision (`str`, *optional*):
            The revision of the repo to which the logs will be pushed. Defaults to "main".
        repo_private (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to make the repo private. If `None` (default), the repo will be public unless the organization's default is private. This value is ignored if the repo already exists.
        path_in_repo (`str`, *optional*):
            The path to the folder in the repo where the logs will be pushed. Defaults to "tensorboard/".
        repo_allow_patterns (`List[str]` or `str`, *optional*):
            A list of patterns to include in the upload. Defaults to `"*.tfevents.*"`. Check out the
            [upload guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/upload#upload-a-folder) for more details.
        repo_ignore_patterns (`List[str]` or `str`, *optional*):
            A list of patterns to exclude in the upload. Check out the
            [upload guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/upload#upload-a-folder) for more details.
        token (`str`, *optional*):
            Authentication token. Will default to the stored token. See https://huggingface.co/settings/token for more
            details
        kwargs:
            Additional keyword arguments passed to `SummaryWriter`.
