class SliceFileObj(AbstractContextManager):
    """
    Utility context manager to read a *slice* of a seekable file-like object as a seekable, file-like object.

    This is NOT thread safe

    Inspired by stackoverflow.com/a/29838711/593036

    Credits to @julien-c

    Args:
        fileobj (`BinaryIO`):
            A file-like object to slice. MUST implement `tell()` and `seek()` (and `read()` of course).
            `fileobj` will be reset to its original position when exiting the context manager.
        seek_from (`int`):
            The start of the slice (offset from position 0 in bytes).
        read_limit (`int`):
            The maximum number of bytes to read from the slice.

    Attributes:
        previous_position (`int`):
            The previous position

    Examples:

    Reading 200 bytes with an offset of 128 bytes from a file (ie bytes 128 to 327):
    ```python
    >>> with open("path/to/file", "rb") as file:
    ...     with SliceFileObj(file, seek_from=128, read_limit=200) as fslice:
    ...         fslice.read(...)
    ```

    Reading a file in chunks of 512 bytes
    ```python
    >>> import os
    >>> chunk_size = 512
    >>> file_size = os.getsize("path/to/file")
    >>> with open("path/to/file", "rb") as file:
    ...     for chunk_idx in range(ceil(file_size / chunk_size)):
    ...         with SliceFileObj(file, seek_from=chunk_idx * chunk_size, read_limit=chunk_size) as fslice:
    ...             chunk = fslice.read(...)

    ```
