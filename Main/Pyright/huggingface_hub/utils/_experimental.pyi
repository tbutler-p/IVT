def experimental(fn: Callable) -> Callable:
    """Decorator to flag a feature as experimental.

    An experimental feature triggers a warning when used as it might be subject to breaking changes without prior notice
    in the future.

    Warnings can be disabled by setting `HF_HUB_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_WARNING=1` as environment variable.

    Args:
        fn (`Callable`):
            The function to flag as experimental.

    Returns:
        `Callable`: The decorated function.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> from huggingface_hub.utils import experimental

    >>> @experimental
    ... def my_function():
    ...     print("Hello world!")

    >>> my_function()
    UserWarning: 'my_function' is experimental and might be subject to breaking changes in the future without prior
    notice. You can disable this warning by setting `HF_HUB_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_WARNING=1` as environment variable.
    Hello world!
