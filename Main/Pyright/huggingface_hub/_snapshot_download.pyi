    """Download repo files.

    Download a whole snapshot of a repo's files at the specified revision. This is useful when you want all files from
    a repo, because you don't know which ones you will need a priori. All files are nested inside a folder in order
    to keep their actual filename relative to that folder. You can also filter which files to download using
    `allow_patterns` and `ignore_patterns`.

    If `local_dir` is provided, the file structure from the repo will be replicated in this location. When using this
    option, the `cache_dir` will not be used and a `.cache/huggingface/` folder will be created at the root of `local_dir`
    to store some metadata related to the downloaded files. While this mechanism is not as robust as the main
    cache-system, it's optimized for regularly pulling the latest version of a repository.

    An alternative would be to clone the repo but this requires git and git-lfs to be installed and properly
    configured. It is also not possible to filter which files to download when cloning a repository using git.

    Args:
        repo_id (`str`):
            A user or an organization name and a repo name separated by a `/`.
        repo_type (`str`, *optional*):
            Set to `"dataset"` or `"space"` if downloading from a dataset or space,
            `None` or `"model"` if downloading from a model. Default is `None`.
        revision (`str`, *optional*):
            An optional Git revision id which can be a branch name, a tag, or a
            commit hash.
        cache_dir (`str`, `Path`, *optional*):
            Path to the folder where cached files are stored.
        local_dir (`str` or `Path`, *optional*):
            If provided, the downloaded files will be placed under this directory.
        library_name (`str`, *optional*):
            The name of the library to which the object corresponds.
        library_version (`str`, *optional*):
            The version of the library.
        user_agent (`str`, `dict`, *optional*):
            The user-agent info in the form of a dictionary or a string.
        proxies (`dict`, *optional*):
            Dictionary mapping protocol to the URL of the proxy passed to
            `requests.request`.
        etag_timeout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `10`):
            When fetching ETag, how many seconds to wait for the server to send
            data before giving up which is passed to `requests.request`.
        force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether the file should be downloaded even if it already exists in the local cache.
        token (`str`, `bool`, *optional*):
            A token to be used for the download.
                - If `True`, the token is read from the HuggingFace config
                  folder.
                - If a string, it's used as the authentication token.
        headers (`dict`, *optional*):
            Additional headers to include in the request. Those headers take precedence over the others.
        local_files_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            If `True`, avoid downloading the file and return the path to the
            local cached file if it exists.
        allow_patterns (`List[str]` or `str`, *optional*):
            If provided, only files matching at least one pattern are downloaded.
        ignore_patterns (`List[str]` or `str`, *optional*):
            If provided, files matching any of the patterns are not downloaded.
        max_workers (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of concurrent threads to download files (1 thread = 1 file download).
            Defaults to 8.
        tqdm_class (`tqdm`, *optional*):
            If provided, overwrites the default behavior for the progress bar. Passed
            argument must inherit from `tqdm.auto.tqdm` or at least mimic its behavior.
            Note that the `tqdm_class` is not passed to each individual download.
            Defaults to the custom HF progress bar that can be disabled by setting
            `HF_HUB_DISABLE_PROGRESS_BARS` environment variable.

    Returns:
        `str`: folder path of the repo snapshot.

    Raises:
        [`~utils.RepositoryNotFoundError`]
            If the repository to download from cannot be found. This may be because it doesn't exist,
            or because it is set to `private` and you do not have access.
        [`~utils.RevisionNotFoundError`]
            If the revision to download from cannot be found.
        [`EnvironmentError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EnvironmentError)
            If `token=True` and the token cannot be found.
        [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError) if
            ETag cannot be determined.
        [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError)
            if some parameter value is invalid.
