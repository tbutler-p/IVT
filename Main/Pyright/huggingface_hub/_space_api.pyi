@dataclass
class SpaceRuntime:
    """
    Contains information about the current runtime of a Space.

    Args:
        stage (`str`):
            Current stage of the space. Example: RUNNING.
        hardware (`str` or `None`):
            Current hardware of the space. Example: "cpu-basic". Can be `None` if Space
            is `BUILDING` for the first time.
        requested_hardware (`str` or `None`):
            Requested hardware. Can be different than `hardware` especially if the request
            has just been made. Example: "t4-medium". Can be `None` if no hardware has
            been requested yet.
        sleep_time (`int` or `None`):
            Number of seconds the Space will be kept alive after the last request. By default (if value is `None`), the
            Space will never go to sleep if it's running on an upgraded hardware, while it will go to sleep after 48
            hours on a free 'cpu-basic' hardware. For more details, see https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-gpus#sleep-time.
        raw (`dict`):
