    The `token` is persisted in cache and set as a git credential. Once done, the machine
    is logged in and the access token will be available across all `huggingface_hub`
    components. If `token` is not provided, it will be prompted to the user either with
    a widget (in a notebook) or via the terminal.

    To log in from outside of a script, one can also use `hf auth login` which is
    a cli command that wraps [`login`].

    > [!TIP]
    > [`login`] is a drop-in replacement method for [`notebook_login`] as it wraps and
    > extends its capabilities.

    > [!TIP]
    > When the token is not passed, [`login`] will automatically detect if the script runs
    > in a notebook or not. However, this detection might not be accurate due to the
    > variety of notebooks that exists nowadays. If that is the case, you can always force
    > the UI by using [`notebook_login`] or [`interpreter_login`].
