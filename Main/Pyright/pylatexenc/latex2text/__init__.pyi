class LatexNodes2Text:
    r"""
    Simplistic Latex-To-Text Converter.

    This class parses a nodes structure generated by the :py:mod:`latexwalker` module,
    and creates a text representation of the structure.

    It is capable of parsing ``\input`` directives safely, see
    :py:meth:`set_tex_input_directory()` and :py:meth:`read_input_file()`.  By default,
    ``\input`` and ``\include`` directives are ignored.

    Arguments to the constructor:

    - `latex_context_db` is a :py:class:`pylatexenc.macrospec.LatexContextDb`
      class storing a collection of rules for converting macros, environments,
      and other latex specials to text.  The `LatexContextDb` should contain
      specifications via :py:class:`MacroTextSpec`,
      :py:class:`EnvironmentTextSpec`, and :py:class:`SpecialsTextSpec` objects.

      The default latex context database can be obtained using
      :py:func:`get_default_latex_context_db()`.

    Additional keyword arguments are flags which may influence the behavior:

    - `math_mode='text'|'with-delimiters'|'verbatim'|'remove'`: Specify how to
      treat chunks of LaTeX code that correspond to math modes.  If 'text' (the
      default), then the math mode contents is incorporated as normal text.  If
      'with-delimiters', the content is incorporated as normal text but it is
      still included in the original math-mode delimiters, such as '$...$'.  If
      'verbatim', then the math mode chunk is kept verbatim, including the
      delimiters.  The value 'remove' means to remove the math mode sections
      entirely and not to produce any replacement text.

    - `keep_comments=True|False`: If set to `True`, then LaTeX comments are kept
      (including the percent-sign); otherwise they are discarded.  (By default
      this is `False`)

    - `fill_text`: If set to `True` or to a positive integer, then the
      whitespace of LaTeX char blocks is re-layed out to fill at the given
      number of characters or 80 by default.  The fill is by far not perfect,
      but the resulting text might be slightly more readable.

    - `strict_latex_spaces=True|False`: If set to `True`, then we follow closely
      LaTeX's handling of whitespace.  For instance, whitespace following a bare
      macro (i.e. without any delimiting characters like '{') is
      consumed/removed.  If set to `False` (the default), then some liberties
      are taken with respect to whitespace [hopefully making the result slightly
      more aesthetic, but this behavior is mostly there for historical reasons].

      You may also use one of the presets
      `strict_latex_spaces='based-on-source'|'macros'|'except-in-equations'`,
      which allow for finer control of how whitespace is handled:

        - The value 'based-on-source' is the option that is furthest from
          latex's behavior with spaces, and takes liberties in incuding spaces
          that are present in the source file in several situations where LaTeX
          would remove them, including after macros.  This is meant to be
          hopefully slightly more aesthetic.  However, this option might
          inadvertently break up words: For instance::

              Sk\l odowska

          would be replaced by::

             Skł odowska

        - The value 'macros' is the same as specifying
          `strict_latex_spaces=False`, and it is the default.  It will make
          macros and other sequences of LaTeX constructions obey LaTeX space
          rules, but will keep indentations after comments and keep more liberal
          whitespace rules in equations for a hopefully more aesthetic result.

        - The 'except-in-equations' preset goes as you would expect, setting
          strict latex spacing only outside of equation contexts.

      Finally, the argument `strict_latex_spaces` may also be set to a
      dictionary with keys 'between-macro-and-chars', 'after-comment',
      'between-latex-constructs', and 'in-equations', with individual values
      either `True` or `False`, dictating whitespace behavior in specific cases
      (`True` indicates strict latex behavior).  The value for 'in-equations'
      may even be another dictionary with the same keys to override values in
      equations.  A value of `False` for 'in-equation' has the same meaning as
      'macros'.

      .. versionchanged:: 2.0

         Since `pylatexenc 2.0`, the default value of `strict_latex_spaces` is
         'macros', and no longer 'based-on-source'.

      .. deprecated:: 2.0

         The value 'default' is also accepted, but it is no longer the default!
         It is an alias for 'based-on-source'

      .. versionchanged:: 2.6

         In `pylatexenc` versions 2.0–2.5, contrary to the documentation, the
         default value of `strict_latex_spaces` was actually still
         'based-on-source'.  This bug was fixed in version 2.6, so that now, the
         default setting is actually 'macros'.

    - `keep_braced_groups=True|False`: If set to `True`, then braces delimiting
      a TeX group ``{Like this}`` will be kept in the output, with the contents
      of the group converted to text as usual.  (By default this is `False`)

    - `keep_braced_groups_minlen=<int>`: If `keep_braced_groups` is set to
      `True`, then we keep braced groups only if their contents length (after
      conversion to text) is longer than the given value.  E.g., if
      `keep_braced_groups_minlen=2`, then ``{\'e}tonnant`` still goes to
      ``étonnant`` but ``{\'etonnant}``
      becomes ``{étonnant}``.

    .. versionadded: 1.4

       Added the `strict_latex_spaces`, `keep_braced_groups`, and
       `keep_braced_groups_minlen` flags

    .. versionadded: 2.0

       Added the `math_mode=` flag to replace the poorly designed
       `keep_inline_math=` flag;

       Added the `fill_text=` flag.

    Additionally, the following arguments are accepted for backwards compatibility:

    - `keep_inline_math=True|False`: Obsolete since `pylatexenc 2`.  If set to
      `True`, then this is the same as `math_mode='verbatim'`, and if set to
      `False`, this is the same as `math_mode='text'`.

      .. deprecated:: 2.0

         The `keep_inline_math=` option is deprecated because it had a weird
         behavior and was poorly implemented, especially given that a similarly
         named option in :py:class:`LatexWalker` had a different effect.  See
         issue :issue:`14`.

    - `text_replacements` this argument is ignored starting from `pylatexenc 2`.

      .. deprecated:: 2.0

         Text replacements are no longer made at the end of the text conversion.
         This feature is replaced by the concept of LaTeX specials---see, e.g.,
         :py:class:`pylatexenc.latexwalker.LatexSpecialsNode`.

         To keep existing code working, add a call to
         :py:meth:`apply_text_replacements()` immediately after
         :py:meth:`nodelist_to_text()` to achieve the same effect as in
         `pylatexenc 1.x`.  See :py:meth:`apply_text_replacements()`.

    - `env_dict`, `macro_dict`: Obsolete since `pylatexenc 2`.  If set, they are
      dictionaries of known environment and macro definitions.  They default to
      :py:data:`default_env_dict` and :py:data:`default_macro_dict`,
      respectively.

      .. deprecated:: 2.0

         You should now use the more powerful option `latex_context_db=`.  You

        If you used custom `text_replacements=` in `pylatexenc 1.x` then you

        might act on text generated from macros and environments and give

           existing code run as it did in `pylatexenc 1.x`.  Its use is however
           not recommended for new code.  You should use "latex specials"
           instead for characters that have special LaTeX meaning.
