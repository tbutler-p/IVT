    This function gets the penalty parameter CPEN so that PREREM = PREREF + CPEN * PREREC > 0.
    See the discussions around equation (9) of the COBYLA paper.

    '''
    This function calculates the ratio between the "typical change" of F and that of CONSTR.
    See equations (12)-(13) in Section 3 of the COBYLA paper for the definition of the ratio.
