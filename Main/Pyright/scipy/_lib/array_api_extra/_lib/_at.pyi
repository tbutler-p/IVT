    Update operations for read-only arrays.

    This implements ``jax.numpy.ndarray.at`` for all writeable
    backends (those that support ``__setitem__``) and routes
    to the ``.at[]`` method for JAX arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array
        Input array.
    idx : index, optional
        Only `array API standard compliant indices
        <https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/API_specification/indexing.html>`_
        are supported.

        You may use two alternate syntaxes::

          >>> import array_api_extra as xpx
          >>> xpx.at(x, idx).set(value)  # or add(value), etc.
          >>> xpx.at(x)[idx].set(value)

    copy : bool, optional
        None (default)
            The array parameter *may* be modified in place if it is
            possible and beneficial for performance.
            You should not reuse it after calling this function.
        True
            Ensure that the inputs are not modified.
        False
            Ensure that the update operation writes back to the input.
            Raise ``ValueError`` if a copy cannot be avoided.

    xp : array_namespace, optional
        The standard-compatible namespace for `x`. Default: infer.

    Returns
    -------
    Updated input array.

    Warnings
    --------
    (a) When you omit the ``copy`` parameter, you should never reuse the parameter
    array later on; ideally, you should reassign it immediately::

        >>> import array_api_extra as xpx
        >>> x = xpx.at(x, 0).set(2)

    The above best practice pattern ensures that the behaviour won't change depending
    on whether ``x`` is writeable or not, as the original ``x`` object is dereferenced
    as soon as ``xpx.at`` returns; this way there is no risk to accidentally update it
    twice.

    On the reverse, the anti-pattern below must be avoided, as it will result in
    different behaviour on read-only versus writeable arrays::

        >>> x = xp.asarray([0, 0, 0])
        >>> y = xpx.at(x, 0).set(2)
        >>> z = xpx.at(x, 1).set(3)

    In the above example, both calls to ``xpx.at`` update ``x`` in place *if possible*.
    This causes the behaviour to diverge depending on whether ``x`` is writeable or not:

    - If ``x`` is writeable, then after the snippet above you'll have
      ``x == y == z == [2, 3, 0]``
    - If ``x`` is read-only, then you'll end up with
      ``x == [0, 0, 0]``, ``y == [2, 0, 0]`` and ``z == [0, 3, 0]``.

    The correct pattern to use if you want diverging outputs from the same input is
    to enforce copies::

        >>> x = xp.asarray([0, 0, 0])
        >>> y = xpx.at(x, 0).set(2, copy=True)  # Never updates x
        >>> z = xpx.at(x, 1).set(3)  # May or may not update x in place
        >>> del x  # avoid accidental reuse of x as we don't know its state anymore

    (b) The array API standard does not support integer array indices.
    The behaviour of update methods when the index is an array of integers is
    undefined and will vary between backends; this is particularly true when the
    index contains multiple occurrences of the same index, e.g.::

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
        >>> import array_api_extra as xpx
        >>> xpx.at(np.asarray([123]), np.asarray([0, 0])).add(1)
        array([124])
        >>> xpx.at(jnp.asarray([123]), jnp.asarray([0, 0])).add(1)
        Array([125], dtype=int32)

    See Also
    --------
    jax.numpy.ndarray.at : Equivalent array method in JAX.

    Notes
    -----
    `sparse <https://sparse.pydata.org/>`_, as well as read-only arrays from libraries
    not explicitly covered by ``array-api-compat``, are not supported by update
    methods.

    Boolean masks are supported on Dask and jitted JAX arrays exclusively
    when `idx` has the same shape as `x` and `y` is 0-dimensional.
    Note that this support is not available in JAX's native
    ``x.at[mask].set(y)``.

    This pattern::

        >>> mask = m(x)
        >>> x[mask] = f(x[mask])

    Can't be replaced by `at`, as it won't work on Dask and JAX inside jax.jit::

        >>> mask = m(x)
        >>> x = xpx.at(x, mask).set(f(x[mask])  # Crash on Dask and jax.jit

    You should instead use::

        >>> x = xp.where(m(x), f(x), x)

    Examples
    --------
    Given either of these equivalent expressions::

      >>> import array_api_extra as xpx
      >>> x = xpx.at(x)[1].add(2)
      >>> x = xpx.at(x, 1).add(2)

    If x is a JAX array, they are the same as::

      >>> x = x.at[1].add(2)

    If x is a read-only NumPy array, they are the same as::

      >>> x = x.copy()
      >>> x[1] += 2

    For other known backends, they are the same as::

      >>> x[1] += 2
