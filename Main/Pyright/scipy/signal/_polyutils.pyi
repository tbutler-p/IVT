"""Partial replacements for numpy polynomial routines, with Array API compatibility.

This module contains both "old-style", np.poly1d, routines from the main numpy
namespace, and "new-style", np.polynomial.polynomial, routines.

To distinguish the two sets, the "new-style" routine names start with `npp_`
