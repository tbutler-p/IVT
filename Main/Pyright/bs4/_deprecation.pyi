"""Helper functions for deprecation.

This interface is itself unstable and may change without warning. Do
not use these functions yourself, even as a joke. The underscores are
there for a reason. No support will be given.

In particular, most of this will go away without warning once
Beautiful Soup drops support for Python 3.11, since Python 3.12
defines a `@typing.deprecated()
decorator. <https://peps.python.org/pep-0702/>`_
