    """Convert modern Python 3.12+ type syntax to standard annotations.

    Handles TypeAliasType and GenericAlias types introduced in Python 3.12+,
    converting them to standard type annotations when needed.

    Args:
        type_annotation: Type to normalize (convert if needed or pass through).

    Returns:
        Normalized type annotation with resolved type aliases and substituted parameters.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Python 3.12+
        >> from typing import Annotated
        >> import annotated_types as at

        >> type NegativeInt = Annotated[int, at.Lt(0)]
        >> type NonEmptyList[T] = Annotated[list[T], at.Len(1)]

        >> normalize_type(NonEmptyList[NegativeInt])
        # typing.Annotated[list[typing.Annotated[int, Lt(lt=0)]], Len(min_length=1, max_length=None)]
