class NsResolver:
    """A class responsible for the namespaces resolving logic for annotations evaluation.

    This class handles the namespace logic when evaluating annotations mainly for class objects.

    It holds a stack of classes that are being inspected during the core schema building,
    and the `types_namespace` property exposes the globals and locals to be used for
    type annotation evaluation. Additionally -- if no class is present in the stack -- a
    fallback globals and locals can be provided using the `namespaces_tuple` argument
    (this is useful when generating a schema for a simple annotation, e.g. when using
    `TypeAdapter`).

    The namespace creation logic is unfortunately flawed in some cases, for backwards
    compatibility reasons and to better support valid edge cases. See the description
    for the `parent_namespace` argument and the example for more details.

    Args:
        namespaces_tuple: The default globals and locals to use if no class is present
            on the stack. This can be useful when using the `GenerateSchema` class
            with `TypeAdapter`, where the "type" being analyzed is a simple annotation.
        parent_namespace: An optional parent namespace that will be added to the locals
            with the lowest priority. For a given class defined in a function, the locals
            of this function are usually used as the parent namespace:

            ```python {lint="skip" test="skip"}
            from pydantic import BaseModel

            def func() -> None:
                SomeType = int

                class Model(BaseModel):
                    f: 'SomeType'

                # when collecting fields, an namespace resolver instance will be created
                # this way:
                # ns_resolver = NsResolver(parent_namespace={'SomeType': SomeType})
            ```

            For backwards compatibility reasons and to support valid edge cases, this parent
            namespace will be used for *every* type being pushed to the stack. In the future,
            we might want to be smarter by only doing so when the type being pushed is defined
            in the same module as the parent namespace.

    Example:
        ```python {lint="skip" test="skip"}
        ns_resolver = NsResolver(
            parent_namespace={'fallback': 1},
        )

        class Sub:
            m: 'Model'

        class Model:
            some_local = 1
            sub: Sub

        ns_resolver = NsResolver()

        # This is roughly what happens when we build a core schema for `Model`:
        with ns_resolver.push(Model):
            ns_resolver.types_namespace
            #> NamespacesTuple({'Sub': Sub}, {'Model': Model, 'some_local': 1})
            # First thing to notice here, the model being pushed is added to the locals.
            # Because `NsResolver` is being used during the model definition, it is not
            # yet added to the globals. This is useful when resolving self-referencing annotations.

            with ns_resolver.push(Sub):
                ns_resolver.types_namespace
                #> NamespacesTuple({'Sub': Sub}, {'Sub': Sub, 'Model': Model})
                # Second thing to notice: `Sub` is present in both the globals and locals.
                # This is not an issue, just that as described above, the model being pushed
                # is added to the locals, but it happens to be present in the globals as well
                # because it is already defined.
                # Third thing to notice: `Model` is also added in locals. This is a backwards
                # compatibility workaround that allows for `Sub` to be able to resolve `'Model'`
                # correctly (as otherwise models would have to be rebuilt even though this
                # doesn't look necessary).
