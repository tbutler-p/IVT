        (background is inherited); merely accessing this property will cause
        the background to be set to NoFill and the inheritance link will be
        interrupted. This is frequently the case for a slide background.

        Of course, if you are accessing this property in order to set the
        fill, then these changes are of no consequence, but the existing
        background cannot be reliably interrogated using this property unless
        you have already established it is an explicit fill.
