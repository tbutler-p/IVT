    An adjustment value corresponds to the position of an adjustment handle on an auto shape.
    Adjustment handles are the small yellow diamond-shaped handles that appear on certain auto
    shapes and allow the outline of the shape to be adjusted. For example, a rounded rectangle has
    an adjustment handle that allows the radius of its corner rounding to be adjusted.

    Values are |float| and generally range from 0.0 to 1.0, although the value can be negative or
